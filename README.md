# IAM Automation Lab 

This repository is my dedicated space for mastering Identity and Access Management (IAM) automation using **PowerShell**.  
I practice automating real-world scenarios for Active Directory, Azure AD, PingOne, and other identity systems.

## Goals

- Automate common IAM tasks (user provisioning, group management, etc.)
- Improve script quality and reliability (logging, error handling)
- Deepen understanding of IAM tools and integrations (Azure AD, PingOne, SailPoint IIQ)

## Skills & Technologies

- PowerShell scripting and automation
- Active Directory & Azure AD management
- SAML/OIDC and Single Sign-On (SSO) implementations

## Structure

- `/scripts`: All automation scripts clearly commented
- `/docs`: Documentation, notes, and cheat sheets for quick reference

## Current scripts available:
| Script Name | Description | Status |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| create_ad_users.ps1 | Bulk-create users from CSV | In progress |
| disable_inactive_users.ps1 | Auto-disable inactive users | Planned |
| audit_group_membership.ps1 | Generate group audit report | Planned |
